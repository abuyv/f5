In this example, I will assume that we are upgrading from 11.5.1 to 12.1.2

**Step 1 : Check the compatibility matrix**

> a) For appliance, check hardware/software compatibility
>
> Link: [https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K9476](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K9476)
>
> b) For virtual edition, check the supported hypervisors matrix
>

>
> Note : If running vCMP systems, verify also the vCMP host and compatible guest version matrix

**Step 2 : Check supported BIG-IP upgrade paths and determine if you can upgrade directly**

> Link: [https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13845](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13845)
>
> In this case, you must be running BIG-IP 10.1.x - 11.x to upgrade directly to BIG-IP 12.x

**Step 3 : Download .iso files needed for the upgrade from F5 Downloads**

> Link: [https://downloads.f5.com/esd/index.jsp](https://downloads.f5.com/esd/index.jsp)

**Step 4 : Check if you need to re-activate the license before upgrading**

> Link: [https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7727](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7727)
>
> First, determine the "License Check Date" of the version you want to install. In this case, the version 12.1.2 was released on 2016-03-18 (License Check Date). Then, determine your "Service check date" by executing the following command from CLI :
>
> `> grep "Service check date" /config/bigip.license`
>
> The output appears similar to the following example:
>
> `> Service check date : 20151008`
>
> As the "Service check date" (20151008) is earlier than the "License Check Date" (2016-03-18), a license a reactivation is needed before upgrading. To reactivate, follow the steps under paragraph "Reactivating the system license" from the link given above.

**Step 5 : Use "iHealth Upgrade Advisor" to determine if any configuration modification is needed before/after the upgrade**

> Link: [https://ihealth.f5.com/](https://ihealth.f5.com/)
>
> Generate a qkview and then upload it to iHealth (link above).
>
> For more info about how to generate a qkview read following article

> For more info about "iHealth Upgrade Advisor" read following article

**Step 6 : Backup the configuration by generating a UCS archive and download it on a safe place**

> Link: [https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132)
>
> a) If are using the "Configuration Utility", follow the procedure under "Backing up configuration data by using the Configuration utility"
>
> b) If you prefer using CLI, follow the procedure under "Backing up configuration data using the tmsh utility"

**Step 7 : From the release note of the version you wish to install read the "Installation checklist"**

> Link: [https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/releasenotes/product/relnote-ltm-12-1-2.html](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/releasenotes/product/relnote-ltm-12-1-2.html)
>
> Under the paragraph "Installation checklist" of the release note, ensure that you have read and verified listed points.
